# Phase 5 — WoZ + SCRIBE on the spec

Goal: set up an interactive Wizard-of-Oz loop for iterating TamedTable's behavior without running phase 4. A fresh Claude Code session loads the WoZ prompt and simulates TamedTable; when behavior is missing, wrong, or surprising, the user invokes SCRIBE in the same session to update the spec. No tests, fixtures, or `.masked` files — validation is interactive.

Prerequisites: SBE's `ops/prompts/prompt-woz.md` and `ops/prompts/prompt-scribe.md` in the sibling repo `~/LOCAL/CODE-2026/Inge-Zel-repo/Zel/ponypen-sbe/SBE` as the starting templates. Current spec lives in [spec/](../../spec/) split across `cli.md`, `core.md`, `data-model.md`, `headless.md`, `runner.md` plus `rationale.md` and `spec.md`.

## Backlog

1. **Restructure `spec/` into two canonical docs plus a prompt file.**
   - `spec/behavior.md` — single API-free behavior doc, WoZ's sole spec input. Sections for data model, core/runner, headless, CLI, system prompts (linking the prompt file below), and v2 web.
   - `spec/code-contract.md` — types, signatures, library choices, env vars, exit codes. Same section structure as `behavior.md`; each section links back to its behavior twin.
   - `spec/prompt-app-edit.md` — extracted verbatim from [src/packages/headless/index.ts](../../src/packages/headless/index.ts) (`SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `BATCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and the per-cell format constraint). Becomes the source of truth; `src/` imports from it.
   - Update `spec/spec.md` to a short index. Delete the old per-surface files once content is moved and nothing under `src/`, `ops/`, or `spec/test-cases/` references them by path.

2. **`ops/prompts/prompt-woz.md`** — adapt from SBE. Drop the `-----` input-block convention. Pin input scope to `spec/behavior.md` and `spec/prompt-app-edit.md` only. Two simulation modes (see §Help text below), auto-selected from user input. For v2 web requests: produce a Claude artifact or write a sketch to `temp/` rather than refusing. Handoff: `scribe: …` switches to SCRIBE persona. Honor `/help` by printing the §Help text below verbatim.

3. **`ops/prompts/prompt-scribe.md`** — adapt from SBE. Strip test-script, web-preview, screenshot-helper, and `prompt-history.md` rules. Add: `behavior.md` is the source of truth; edit `code-contract.md` only when API surface changes; edit `prompt-app-edit.md` directly for prompt tuning; never modify `src/`, `ops/phases/`, or `spec/test-cases/*.feature`. Honor `/help` with the same §Help text as WoZ (single session, single help surface).

4. **Wire `src/packages/headless/index.ts`** to import the three prompts from `spec/prompt-app-edit.md` at load time (parse by `##` headers). Confirm `bun run test` stays green.

## Help text

WoZ and SCRIBE both print this verbatim on `/help`:

```
TamedTable WoZ — interactive behavior simulator. Two simulation modes,
auto-selected from what you type:

  deterministic   Input that starts with `/` or `execute <flow>`. Slash
                  commands, table renders, exit codes, {js}/{const} columns.
                  Output matches the real TamedTable byte-for-byte.

  patch           Everything else — natural-language transformation requests
                  ("add column X…", "filter where Y…"). Emits the JSON Patch
                  the spec-editor LLM should produce per prompt-app-edit.md.
                  If that patch touches an {llm: …} column, 3–5 synthesized
                  sample cell values are appended (plausible, not golden).
                  Prefix `patch only:` to suppress synthesis.

Commands:
  /help            Show this.
  scribe: <note>   Switch to SCRIBE; capture <note> as a spec edit.
```

## Definition of done
- `spec/behavior.md` and `spec/code-contract.md` exist; old per-surface specs deleted; `bun run test` passes against the new prompt-import wiring.
- `spec/behavior.md` reads cleanly with no TypeScript types, method names, library names, or env-var names — those live in `code-contract.md`.
- A fresh Claude Code session loading `ops/prompts/prompt-woz.md` can simulate a representative CLI exchange (e.g. `/undo` on empty history, adding an `{llm: …}` column) without reading anything outside `spec/behavior.md` and `spec/prompt-app-edit.md`.
- Asking WoZ a web-UI question (v2) produces an artifact or a `temp/` sketch.
